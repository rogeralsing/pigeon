# Lease-Based Access Control System

## General Definition

A **lease-based access control system** is a distributed coordination mechanism in which access to a resource is granted by issuing a lease, or token, that represents temporary permission to access a resource. The lease must be acquired by any process intending to interact with the resource. This mechanism often involves the following elements:

1. **Lease or Token**: A unique identifier or permission granted to a process, typically with an expiration time or conditional constraints, indicating that the process is allowed to use or modify the resource.

2. **Granting Authority**: A central or distributed authority responsible for issuing leases. It ensures that leases are issued according to predefined access policies, and it may limit the number of leases (e.g., exclusive or shared access).

3. **Expiration and Renewal**: Leases are time-bound and may need periodic renewal to maintain access. When a lease expires, the resource becomes accessible to other processes, enabling fair access or reducing resource contention.

4. **Revocation**: Leases may be revoked under certain conditions (e.g., priority overrides, fault tolerance), requiring the process holding the lease to release the resource.

5. **Concurrency Control**: The system often uses leases as a synchronization mechanism to manage concurrent access, prevent race conditions, and enforce mutually exclusive access when necessary.

## Akka.Coordination.Lease

`Akka.Coordination.Lease` is an abstraction in the Akka.NET that provides a way to control access to resources in distributed environments. It enables a process to acquire exclusive access to a resource through a lease. The lease is represented by an abstract class `Lease`, allowing various lease implementations that define specific lease implementations.

### Key Characteristics and Components

* **Lease Name**: A unique identifier for the lease, which specifies the resource to be protected.
* **Owner Name**: A unique identifier for the entity (usually an actor or node) that is attempting to acquire the lease.
* **Lease Timeout**: A duration parameter that specifies how long the lease should last. Leases may be renewed or revoked depending on the implementation.

### Operations

The `Akka.Coordination.Lease` API provides the following key operations:

* **`Task<bool> Acquire()`**
* **`Task<bool> Acquire(Action<Exception> leaseLostCallback)`**

  This asynchronous operation attempts to acquire the lease for the resource. It returns a `Task<bool>`, indicating if the acquisition was successful or not. Parameters may include callback delegate method that will be invoked when a granted lease have been revoked for some reason.

* **`Task<bool> Release()`**

  This asynchronous operation releases the lease, relinquishing the access rights to the resource. It returns a `Task<bool>`, where true indicates successful release. This operation is important for ensuring that resources are freed up for other actors or nodes once a task is completed.

* **`bool CheckLease()`**

  This operation checks whether the lease is still valid, typically returning a Boolean. `CheckLease()` is useful for verifying if a lease has expired or been revoked, ensuring that processes do not operate under an invalid lease.

### Automatic Expiry and Renewal

Some lease implementations in Akka.NET may support automatic expiry or renewal mechanisms. Expiry ensures that leases do not remain active indefinitely, which can prevent resource deadlock or starvation scenarios.

### Officially Supported Lease Implementations

There are currently two officially supported lease implementations:

* [Akka.Coordination.KubernetesApi](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.Management/tree/dev/src/coordination/kubernetes/Akka.Coordination.KubernetesApi)
* [Akka.Coordination.Azure](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.Management/tree/dev/src/coordination/azure/Akka.Coordination.Azure)

Both lease implementation supports automatic lease expiry and renewal.

## Example

The full code for this example can be seen inside the [Akka.NET repo](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/blob/dev/src/core/Akka.Docs.Tests/Utilities/LeaseActorDocSpec.cs)

### Internal Messages

The actor using `Lease` will need a few boilerplate internal messages:

### Obtaining Reference To Lease Implementation

To obtain a reference to the `Lease` implementation, you will need 4 things:

* **Lease Name**: A unique identifier for the lease, which specifies the resource to be protected.
* **Owner Name**: A unique identifier for the entity (usually an actor or node) that is attempting to acquire the lease.
* **Configuration Path**: A full HOCON configuration path containing the definition of the lease implementation.
* **Retry Interval**: A time duration needed for failed lease acquisition retry.

A `Lease` reference is then obtained by calling `LeaseProvider.Get(Context.System).GetLease()`

### Actor States

The actor leverages actor states to separate the lease acquisition and actual working state of the actor.

* **`AcquiringLease` State**
  In this state, the actor will only handle the required internal messages related to lease acquisition. Any other messages not related to lease acquisition will be stashed until the lease is acquired/granted. The actor will automatically retry lease acquisition by calling `AcquireLease()` on a regular basis if it failed to acquire a lease.
* **`Active` State**
  In this state, the actor is active and is allowed to process all received messages normally. The only lease related message being processed is the `LeaseLost` internal message that signals lease revocation.

In the event of a lease revocation, the actor will forcefully shuts down to prevent resource contention. This may be modified to suit user needs.

### Lease Lifecycle

Lease needs to be granted before an actor can perform any of its message handling and the actor needs to stop, forcefully or gracefully, if the lease is revoked. Attention must be taken so that, in the event of revoked lease, there would be no resource contention, or at least with minimal impact.

In the example code, lease would be acquired inside the `PreStart()` method override by calling `AcquireLease()` and it will be released inside the `PostStop()` method override.
